## Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:

1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `Reformat Code` feature of Android Studio `CMD`+`Option`+`L` on Mac and `CTRL` + `ALT` + `L` on Linux + Windows .
2. If its a feature, bug fix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
4. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
5. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/Yogeshk4124/Gmail-ui-clone/issues) first, before filing an issue.
6. Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do
7. Have fun!<br>
